This is a polygon coverage of major land uses in the United
States.  The source of the coverage is the map of major land
uses in the National Atlas, pages 158-159, which was adapted
from U.S.  Department of Agriculture, "Major Land Uses in the
United States," by Francis J. Marschner, revised by James
R. Anderson, 1967.
</abstract>
			<purpose>

The intended use of this coverage is in the state sections of
the 1990-91 National Water Summary on surface-water quality.
Each state report will contain a map of the state's major land
uses and, if possible, will discuss the influence of land use on
water quality in the state.
</purpose>
			<supplinf>

The coverage contains one polygon attribute, LUC (land use
code).  LUC is derived from the categories of land use listed in
the National Atlas plus a category for open water. The codes are:

1 = Mostly cropland;
2 = Cropland with grazing land;
3 = Cropland with pasture, woodland, and forest;
4 = Irrigated land;
5 = Woodland and forest with some cropland and pasture;
6 = Forest and woodland mostly grazed;
7 = Forest and woodland mostly ungrazed;
8 = Subhumid grassland and semiarid grazing land;
9 = Open woodland grazed (pinon, juniper, aspen groves,
chaparral and brush);
10 = Desert shrubland grazed;
11 = Desert shrubland mostly ungrazed;
12 = Alpine meadows, mountain peaks above timber line,
sparse dry tundra, lava flows, and barren land;
13 = Swamp;
14 = Marshland;
15 = Moist tundra and muskeg;
16 = Urban areas;
17 = Open water;
99 = Great Lakes, Canada.

(The SYMBOL attribute was used for plotting.)

The coverage contains one arc attribute, KEEP.  This is a flag
for plotting the arc or not.  The area of some polygons exceeded
the limit for hardware fill on the Versatec plotter, so arcs
were added to divide the polygons into smaller ones.  The arcs
that divide up the large polygons are not plotted as the
boundaries of land use categories.

The arc codes are: 0 = Divides a large polygon (is not to be plotted);
1 = Land use boundary;
2 = Coastline or island boundary.

There are separate coverages for Alaska and Hawaii.

The scale of the data (1:7,500,000) limits its use to
broad overviews of land use.

Several areas on the scanned map did not register properly with
existing 1:2,000,000 base maps.  The areas are southwest New
Mexico to southwest California and the northwest corner of Maine.
The original ticks appear to be located properly.  The discrepancy
might be due to different source maps or error in transforming the
scanned copy.

The coverage was created from the National Atlas plate by Kerie Hitt,
USGS National Water Summary.

Jack Wittmann from NMD supplied a clear plastic overlay of the
linework for the National Atlas plate.  The plastic overlay
was scanned on the TEK 4991 drum scanner in the Reston GIS
lab.  The parameters on the scanner were:

Units = metric;
Reflectance = 55%;
Background = light;
Void size = 1 pixel;
Dot size = 5 x 5 pixels;
Smoothing = disabled;
Growing layers = 0;
Thinning layers = 2;
Vectorizing tolerance = 0.100;
Short vector length = 0.000;
Short vector tolerance = 0.100.

The resulting TDA file was uploaded to the Prime and was
coverted to an ARC/INFO coverage (LANDUSE1) using Ken
Lanfear's TEKSCAN.AML.  The rest of the processing was
accomplished with ARC/INFO.

LANDUSE1 was ARCEDITED, and Alaska, Hawaii, pie charts,
explanation, and other extraneous pieces were removed.  The
original tics were deleted and 13 new tics at the locations of
latitude/longitude drawn on the plastic were added.  The
coverage was saved to LANDUSE2.

A file (US.LL.TICKS) listing the latitude/longitude of the 13
known locations on the map was projected from Geographic to
Albers (US.ALB.TICKS).

An empty coverage called LANDUSE5 was created using the TIC
file of LANDUSE2.  The XTIC and YTIC values of LANDUSE5 were
updated to match the Albers coordinates in US.ALB.TICKS.

The coverage was transformed into real world coordinates
(see log below).

The dangling arcs were removed by CLEANING and ARCEDITING.
Spiderwebbing along the coastline was removed by ARCEDITING.
After polygon topology was built, interior polygons having
small areas were checked and the ones that were not part of
the land use categories were removed.

The linework on the plastic overlay that was scanned did not
always agree with the published land use map.  In such cases,
the linework of the published map was used instead of the scan
copy.

After the linework was checked, the polygons were tagged using
ARCEDIT.

Dick Paulson checked color plots of all states except Alaska
and Hawaii.

The dataset was reviewed on a state-by-state basis when state
maps of the data were published in the state summaries in the
1990-91 National Water Summary report (U.S. Geological
Survey, 1993).  The dataset was used in most of the State
Summaries of that report.

The dataset had been deleted from the spatial library by mistake.

Imported an archival copy in SDTS format.  Projected from Geographic
to Albers.  Also made a non-propriety shapefile.

Put the coverage metadata into FGDC-compliant form.

Put all back into the spatial data library.   --Kerie Hitt, USGS
